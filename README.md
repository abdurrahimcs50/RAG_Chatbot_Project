## Introduction

Welcome to the **RAG-Enhanced Chatbot Application**, a powerful and scalable chatbot solution that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. Built with Streamlit, Python, and advanced language models from OpenAI, this application is designed to enhance user interactions by integrating document and web-based knowledge sources.

Whether you're developing an e-commerce platform, a real estate service, or any application that requires dynamic and informed conversational agents, our chatbot offers the flexibility and robustness you need.

## Features

- **OpenAI GPT-4 Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 models for advanced language generation.
- **RAG Integration**: Enhance chatbot responses by uploading documents or providing URLs, enabling the chatbot to retrieve and utilize external knowledge.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive Streamlit-based UI with sidebar controls for API key management, model selection, and RAG source uploads.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of user interactions, model selections, and system events stored in a dedicated `logs/` folder with log rotation.
- **Real-Time Date & Time**: Displays the current date and time for better context and user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Secure API Key Handling**: Secure input fields for API keys with sensitive information protection.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the RAG-Enhanced Chatbot Application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-chatbot.git
   cd rag-chatbot
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   AZ_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
   ```

   *Ensure that you replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys.*

5. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Access the App**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

1. **API Key Management**

   - Navigate to the sidebar to enter your OpenAI API keys.
   - These keys are essential for authenticating and utilizing the OpenAI GPT-4 models.

2. **Model Selection**

   - Choose your preferred language model from the dropdown menu in the sidebar.
   - Options include `openai/gpt-4o`, `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, and `azure-openai/gpt-4o` depending on your API keys.

3. **RAG Source Uploads**

   - **Upload Documents**: Click on the "Upload Documents for RAG Processing" button to upload PDFs, TXT, DOCX, or MD files.
   - **Add URLs**: Enter a URL to integrate web-based content into the chatbot's knowledge base.

4. **Chat Interface**

   - Type your message in the chat input field and press Enter.
   - The assistant will respond based on your input and the integrated RAG sources.

5. **Logging**

   - All interactions and system events are logged in the `logs/` directory.
   - Logs are rotated to prevent excessive file sizes, ensuring efficient storage management.

6. **Clear Chat**

   - Use the "Clear Chat" button in the sidebar to reset the conversation history.

## Logging

The application employs Python's built-in `logging` module to capture and store logs systematically.

- **Log Directory**: All logs are stored in the `logs/` folder.
- **Log Rotation**: Logs are rotated after reaching 5 MB, with up to 5 backup logs maintained to prevent storage issues.
- **Log Contents**:
  - Session initializations
  - API key inputs (without exposing the keys)
  - Model selections
  - RAG source uploads
  - User messages and assistant responses
  - Error and warning messages
